# NFT MARKETPLACE
Welcome to the NFT Platform project, a Django-powered marketplace designed for the seamless purchase and sale of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This platform is equipped with robust features, including user registration and authentication through the MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet. Built on Django, the backend leverages Django Rest Framework (DRF) for efficient and secure API endpoints.

## Features:
* **MetaMask Integration:** Seamlessly register and authenticate users through the popular MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience.
* **DRF-powered Views:** Utilizing Django Rest Framework, our project employs powerful views to handle various aspects of the NFT marketplace, ensuring efficient data communication and interaction.
* **SQLite Database:** The default Django database, SQLite, is employed to manage the data efficiently. It provides a lightweight, serverless, and easy-to-set-up solution for development purposes.
